# Real Time Chat Application
A real-time chat application is a computer program that allows users to communicate with each other over the internet in real-time. Unlike traditional messaging systems, which require users to refresh the page to see new messages, real-time chat applications allow users to see messages as they are being typed and sent by other users.

Used HTML, CSS to create the frontend part of the project and installed required packages, created the server to develop backend using node.js. Created the chat interface and used Socket.IO to handle the real time communication. Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
